Knowledge-Based Agent: Agents that reason by operating on internal representations of knowledge.

	-If it didn't rain, Harry visited Hagrid today.
	-Harry visited Hagrid or Dumbledore today, but not both.
	-Harry visited Dumbledore today.
	-Harry did ot visit Hagrid today.
	-It rained today.

Sentence: An assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language.

Knowledge Base: A set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent.

Entailment: a=b
   In every model in which sentence a is true, sentence b is also true.

Inference: The process of deriving new sentences from old ones. 

Model Checking: 
     -To determine if KB=a:
	-Enumerate all possible models.
	-If in every model where KB is true, a is true, then KB entails a.
	-Otherwise, KB does not entail a.

Theorem Proving:
	-Initial State: Starting knowledge based
	-Actions: Inference rules
	-Transition Model: New knowledge base after inference
	-Goal Test: Check statement we're trying to prove
	-Path Cost Function: Number of steps in proof

Clause: A disjunction of literals.
	e.g. Pv v Q	v R

Conjunctive Normal Form: Logical sentence that is a conjunction of clauses
	e.g. (A v B v C) v (D v E) v (F v G)

Conversion to CNF 
	-Eliminate biconditionals
		-Turn (a <-> b) into (a -> b) v (b -> a)
	-Eliminate implications
		-Turn (a -> b) into a v B
	-Move inwards using De Morgan's Laws
		-e.g. turn (a v b) into a v B
	-Use distributive laws to distribute v wherever possible

Interence by Resolution
	-To determine if KB = a:
	-Check if (KB v a) is a contradiction?
		-If so, then KB = a.
		-Otherwise, no entailment.

Interence by Resolution
	-To determine if KB = a:
		-Convert (KB v a) to Conjunctive Normal Form.
		-Keep checking to see if we can use resulation to produce a new clause.
			-If ever we produce the empty clause (equivalent to False), we have a contradiction, and KB = a.
			-Otherwise, if we can't  add new clauses, no entailment.
